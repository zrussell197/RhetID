RhetID analyzes your text for elements of famous authors to decide who you most wrtie like.

### Packages

#### POS

- The `pos` package is used to house all the Part of Speech tagging classes. 
- Note that part of speech tagging relies on the `.map` and `.set` files in PosFiles.

#### Zipf

- The `zipf` package is used to house all the classes for implementing Zipf's law.
- Note the implementation must take a word at a time to reduce algorithmic complexity.

#### Author

- The `author` package will house data types for holding authors statistics and trends.
- Will be done statically in the same manner as POS.

#### Elements
__Name Change Pending__

- The `elements` package will house the shorter algorithms to track various other elements of textual analysis.
- Likely will implement a data sructure that will analyze all elements in a single add function.
